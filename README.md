# Double Pendulum --> Random Bitstream
This program uses the Python Imaging Library to open images of my double pendulum model to generate a random bitstream based on the average pixel values. I am working to both create a better pendulum model and test the random bits as per the National Institute of Standards and Technology's guidelines
